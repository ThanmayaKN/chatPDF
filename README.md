# ChatPDF

ChatPDF is a Python-based project designed to answer any queries from PDFs uploaded in the data folder. By leveraging Langchain, locally running Ollama LLM models, and ChromaDB, the project provides advanced language modeling, embeddings, and efficient data storage to facilitate accurate and efficient text processing.

## Features

- **Advanced Embeddings**: Utilizes `OllamaEmbeddings` for high-quality text embeddings.
- **Query Processing**: Efficiently handles and processes text queries from uploaded PDFs.
- **Integration with Langchain**: Seamlessly integrates with the Langchain framework for enhanced capabilities.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Uses ChromaDB for scalable and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Local LLM Execution**: Runs Ollama LLM models locally on the machine to ensure quick and reliable query processing.

## Usage

This project is developed using Python and incorporates cutting-edge AI technologies to provide robust text processing and data storage solutions.

## Configuration

Ensure your configuration is correct by verifying the availability of the necessary models and that any required API endpoints are running and accessible.
